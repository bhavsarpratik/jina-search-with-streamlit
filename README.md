In this demo, we use Jina to build a semantic search system on the [ICD10 codes](https://www.icd10data.com/).  


## Index data  
You don't need to index data as the index is provided in workspace folder.
Run the below command if you want to index ICD10 data. This can take some time and you can try a smaller n as well.
```bash
python app.py --task index -n 1000
```

## Start Jina server for query  
```bash
python app.py --task query 
```

## Start Streamlit demo  
You dont need to start jina server if you want to run demo as it is taken care.
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
